      <pre > Huggy Wuggy is a toy produced by Playtime Co. and a secondary antagonist of the Poppy Playtime franchise, debuting in Chapter 1: "A Tight Squeeze" as the main antagonist.

<pre>In Chapter 1: "A Tight Squeeze", Huggy Wuggy is initially introduced as a living entity created in 1990 under the Bigger Bodies Initiative. After The Player returns to 
the Playtime Co. Factory, he is depicted as a statue located in the Main Lobby of the factory. However, once The Player restores power to the entire facility, Huggy mysteriously 
disappears. Throughout the chapter, Huggy makes occasional, brief appearances until 
he finally reveals himself and starts chasing The Player during the intense Ventilation Chase sequence. 
Towards the end of the chapter, he is seen plummeting deep into the abyss of the factory, presumed to be dead. <img width="200"  src="./New Huggy Death.webp" alt="">
</pre><pre>During Chapter 3: "Deep Sleep", Huggy Wuggy makes a minor appearance as an antagonist. While trapped in a hallucination caused by 
CatNap's gas, The Player discovers a VHS Tape that greets new employees. As the tape plays, the game forcefully compels 
The Player to watch as a distorted, nightmarish version of Huggy emerges from the screen and begins to pursue them. 
He quickly catches them and jumpscares them, causing them to wake up from their nightmare.
</pre>

<pre>In the ending of Chapter 4: "Safe Haven", Huggy appears, damaged, after 
The Player watches the security tape, revealing that he has survived the fall from Chapter 1, battered and wounded as 
he furiously rushes and tries to attack The Player through a glass wall for trying to kill him, indicating his pursuit 
for revenge on The Player for his "death" in Chapter 1.
</pre>
<pre>Experiment 1170, his Bigger Bodies experiment title, was created with obedient qualities, enabling 
the Playtime Co. staff to train Huggy to serve as a security measure for 
the factory during guest visits. However, these obedient traits became corrupted as the Prototype redirected Huggy's objectives. Before his highly anticipated debut, 
Huggy was required to stand and patiently wait for the arrival of a human presence, specifically The Player. He was an active participant in 
The Hour of Joy, during which he murdered and devoured many employees and visitors.

<pre>apearance
Chapter 1: "A Tight Squeeze"
Huggy Wuggy is a tall, slender creature covered in thick, bright blue fur. His arms and legs are disproportionately long and end in 
large yellow hands and feet. 
His hands have large Velcro straps on the palms, and both they and his feet possess four digits, including thumbs, though they are merely just stitches 
and are unable to move individually (with the exception of the thumbs). His torso is 
stout and disproportionately small in comparison to his long limbs. 
His head is large and contains two large black, dilated eyes. On his face are oversized, cartoonish, bright red lips. He also wears a thin blue bowtie around his neck.
</pre>His monster counterpart mostly remains the same, with the exception of his eyes being dilated bigger than intended, giving off 
a deranged and disturbing appearance. Behind his lips is a 
maw of dozens of jagged needle-like teeth. Closer observation of Huggy's mouth shows a secondary set of jaws located near his throat, 
akin to that of a moray eel, resembling human teeth.
<pre>

(Using the tallest man Robert Wadlow's height and weight of 8'11 and 439 lbs, and his BMI of 27, Huggy Wuggy's height and weight can be estimated to be around 18'0 and 1795 lbs.)


</pre>Chapter 3: "Deep Sleep"
His nightmare form is similar to the original Huggy's, but he is now much taller, his face is more skewed, his blue fur is much darker, his mouth 
has been elongated, and the side parts at the top of his head are shaped into devilish horns. He has two black sockets in place of his eyes, and 
his teeth are longer and thinner, while he lacks the second row of teeth at the back of his throat. The rest of his body remains the same, but 
his hands and feet now have splayed, elongated fingers and toes that resemble claws.

<pre>

</pre><pre>Chapter 4: "Safe Haven"
As a result of the fall in Chapter 1, Huggy has gained noticeable injuries on several areas of his body; a part of the left side of his head is missing, his lower left arm is 
completely gone, and parts of his fur are missing revealing his "bones" or lack thereof, which appear to have been stitched together with pieces of rope. He also has what 
look like thin white bandages wrapped around his chest, right arm and left leg. His bowtie can also be seen on the stump of his left arm.
</pre>

<pre>Personality
Originally marketed as a toy intended solely for providing platonic love through
 hugging, Huggy Wuggy was designed to hug children in need, with warm traits.
</pre>
<pre>Huggy Forest Jumpscare
Huggy stalking and killing someone during RESTRICTED_disappearance.
Meanwhile, his Bigger Bodies counterpart retained a similar purpose, serving as a guardian to children and only reacting aggressively 
when faced with hostility. This was exemplified on June 18, 1992, when Huggy went on a rampage upon being attacked with darts. He was known to be "obedient" as long as no aggression was directed towards him,
 which was explicitly stated in Log 08502. However, under the influence of the Prototype, Huggy transformed into a relentless, genocidal entity driven by 
 his given objectives, lacking control and mercilessly killing anyone who stood in his way.

When The Player returned in 2005, Huggy strictly adhered to the objectives given by the Prototype. His task was to surveil and protect the Playtime Co. factory, alerting others to the presence of any new intruders.
 Huggy took a 
stealthy approach, stalking The Player until finally confronting them with a lethal embrace. When the two meet again at the end of Chapter 4: "Safe Haven", Huggy furiously pounds on the door separating him and 
The Player and roars at them, indicating he is absolutely infuriated for what The Player had done to him and is determined to get revenge.
<pre>History
</pre>

Before Poppy Playtime
Huggy Wuggy was created by Playtime Co. in 1984, and he quickly became a huge success and one of the many signature toys of Playtime Co.  
A female counterpart, Kissy Missy, was created in 1985. In 1990, Playtime Co. started the Bigger Bodies Initiative, conducting numerous unethical 
and highly illegal experiments on the orphans who lived in Playcare, one such example being Huggy Wuggy, who was known as Experiment 1170. 
His purpose was to function as part of the factory's security,[1] while spending the day posing as a statue in the Main Lobby.

In March 1991, Huggy Wuggy was noticed by visitors to be looking at them. Rowan Stoll reported 
their complaints to Leith Pierre on the 30th, believing someone could have put nanny cameras in Huggy Wuggy's eyes. On May 28, Rowan sent an apology to Leith, explaining a maintenance
 worker told him the eyes were not locked in place, giving the illusion they were moving.[2][3]

<pre> Disappearance incident
At 10:27 PM on June 18, 1992, Experiment 1170 managed to escape the Playtime Co. factory through an open bay delivery door. Two staff members witnessed his swift 
escape and hit the alarm. He traveled nearly a half-mile from the factory before a survival team was deployed at 10:30 PM. One employee, presumably a male adult,
 was driving through the forest in an attempt to catch up with  
170 by driving to the railroad covering most of the land around the factory. He quickly stopped when he came across a creature wandering around in the forest.
 Aggressively and swiftly, Huggy rammed himself straight into his car's windshield, frightening him and resulting in him attempting to shoot Huggy with tranquilizer darts. The man successfully shot Huggy, but died at his hands in the process.

At 10:38 PM, the security team began to block and surround 1170 at a railroad crossing. Catching up with Huggy, they successfully shot him with a tranquilizer dart in 
his left leg. Unfortunately, he escaped back into the forest. The security team then spread outwards using their increased search radius of four miles. However, their radios became unreliable as they were outside of 
the effective zone. At 11:33 PM, an unknown security worker roamed the woods, encountering the fresh corpse of a deer. They then heard crunching and snaps 
before Huggy Wuggy appeared, staring down at them ominously before presumably killing them. Later, the worker's still recording camera would capture 
Huggy Wuggy loudly shrieking in the woods. At 3:38 AM, a camera caught Huggy Wuggy motionlessly standing in front of a suburban house. Huggy would later be caught and brought back to 
the factory over five hours after his escape. Five workers had died and six were unaccounted for.
</pre><br>
<br>
After the incident, Leith Pierre wrote a document explaining how 1170 escaped the factory through the ventilation system, stating 
it was only blind luck that he was caught before being seen by anyone else. He concluded his document by saying that neither he nor the Innovation Department were happy regarding what had happened that night. 
These events would be documented in a restricted VHS tape and a security report.[4]
      <pre>The Hour of Joy 
HourofJoyHuggyScene
Huggy Wuggy killing a series of civilians in the Main Lobby.On August 8, 1995, half a decade after the disappearance 
of the Prototype, an emergency warning was broadcasted upon all televisions and electronics in the Playtime Co. factory. It was stated for all employees to hide 
as the experiments' rampage against Playtime Co. began. It is 
heavily implied to have begun with Huggy Wuggy being influenced by the Prototype to mindlessly kill all of the employees in the Main Lobby. This was all depicted in the Hour of Joy VHS recording, 
which recorded snippets of Huggy Wuggy and various other toys, such as Mommy Long Legs, the Ruined Critters, Miss Delight and her sisters, Kissy Missy, Boxy Boo, and CatNap, in that order as shown via the tape.

<pre>Project: Playtime
Main article: Huggy Wuggy (Project Playtime)
After the catastrophic events of The Hour of Joy, Leith Pierre emerged as one of the few known survivors. 
Driven by his determination to carry on with the Bigger Bodies Initiative, Leith Pierre began sending out 
“Resource Extraction Specialists" in groups of six at a time into the Playtime Co. factory, where rampant toys 
roamed freely. Their mission was to retrieve artifacts related to the Bigger Bodies experiments, 
despite the threatening risk of facing potential death. In the end, this project would fall futile as, canonically, the 
employees would be killed by the toys and fed to the smaller 
Bigger Bodies experiments such as the Wuggies and the Ruined Critters.                          
</pre>


    <pre>During the Monster Tutorial, it is divulged that Huggy Wuggy plays a vital role as one of the selected
       toys assigned by the Prototype to provide sustenance to the smaller experiments.

After the company stopped sending out the Specialists, leaving the factory closed for good, Huggy and 
the other experiments were left without a source of food. Desperate and 
out of options, he and the other 

bigger experiments began to eat the smaller toys to survive. Huggy continued to 
live in the abandoned factory for the next decade until The Player's return in 2005.

During Poppy Playtime
</pre>                           


<pre>Chapter 1: "A Tight Squeeze"
Huggy first appears when The Player enters the Main Lobby after unlocking Security, where they had obtained 
the GrabPack and its Blue Hand. Upon making an attempt to open a closed door that required
 the Blue Hand, the power cuts off. However, Huggy could now be seen with an unexpected attainable 
 yellow key hung on his "fingers." This key opens the Power Room, which requires a mere electric current 
 towards two nodes. This can be done using the GrabPack's
  electricity-conducting wires.</pre>
<pre> Advertisement Chapter 2: "Fly in a Web" Huggy does not make an appearance in this chapter, but is instead mentioned in the second tape discussing
     Experiment 1006, in which he was confirmed to be a different entity, as he went with the alias Experiment 1170 instead. In the Water Treatment zone, lots of blue 
     fur can be seen on the walls of the zone, implying he had landed here during his fall. Even though he's not in the chapter, smaller versions of him known as
      Mini Huggies appear in the Wack-a-Wuggy game in Game Station.
     <img width="400"  src="./blue fura.jpeg" alt=""></pre>
<pre>Chapter 3: "Deep Sleep"
    Home Sweet Home
    Upon entering Home Sweet Home, The Player encounters the Red Smoke. Despite Ollie's warnings, they walk through
     it and ultimately pass out in the real world. In a dream-like state, Home Sweet Home twists into a nightmarish labyrinth filled with unsettling images of children and eerie messages 
    etched into the wood. The disturbing scene climaxes when The Player reaches an unknown nursing room. A tape titled 
    Welcome To Playtime" sits on a bed. On the screen as the tape plays is a picture of Huggy, and over 
    the course of the tape, it begins to outright call out employees who may be unhappy with something they've 
    "done". The picture of Huggy fades away, to soon be replaced by a picture of Nightmare Huggy.
    
    
    NightmareHuggyJumpscare

    <img width="200"  src="./Nightmare Huggy Jumpscare.webp" alt="">
    During the concluding segment of the tape, the tape begins to take a more monotone turn as the announcer directly calls 
    out The Player's actions for not being present 
     for the other toys, mocking them for descending downwards into the factory. The announcer 
    describes the factory as "their world", and welcomes The Player "home". Suddenly, 
    a monstrous version of Huggy Wuggy emerges from the TV and begins chasing The Player.
    
    Defenseless, they have no choice but to head down the never-ending corridor they 
    had previously entered. The monstrous Huggy Wuggy taunts The Player, intentionally slowing down as they approach, before finally delivering a jumpscare. The Player suddenly wakes up in the real world, lying on the floor.
    </pre>
    <pre>
       
        
        CatNap Dream Sequence
        Later on during the runtime of Chapter 3, CatNap knocks The
         Player out and puts them through a lucid trance. Using the 
         voice of Poppy, CatNap attempts to dissuade The Player from delving further into the Playtime Co. Factory.

        <img width="200"  src="./Flash back Huggy.webp" alt="">
        Towards the end of the dream sequence, 
        The Player finds themselves in a 
        spiralling red cloud with only the presence of Huggy Wuggy. CatNap, speaking through Poppy's voice, questions them, 
        "Do you know what's real?" and then declares, "No, you don't," in a more focused tone than before, ending the echoing. 
        The Player is later taken to the Main Lobby yet again, overrun with the Red Smoke and its glass dome shattered open. Presumably 
        taking the perspective of Huggy Wuggy, the Prototype reaches down towards The Player, which can later be called back to the 
        beginning of The Hour of Joy when Huggy was taken control of by the Prototype and ordered to kill anything in sight.</pre><pre>

            Chapter 4: "Safe Haven"
            During her conversation with The Prototype, Poppy lists Huggy Wuggy as an example of him having no more allies.

            After inputting and watching the final tape of Chapter 4: "Safe Haven", Huggy Wuggy staggers into the labs, 
            summoned by the alarm activated by the tape. Due to the lighting, he initially appears to be Kissy Missy, 
            but, as he approaches, his mouth full of fangs becomes visible. He aggressively charges towards and bashes at 
            the windowed entrance of the top-secret laboratory of Playtime Co., presumably ready to guard the place from 
            the Player and have his revenge.
